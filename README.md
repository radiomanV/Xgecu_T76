# Xgecu T76
## Documentation and Utilities for the XGecu T76 Programmer

Here you can find a useful script for converting a bitstream file generated by Anlogic TD IDE   
into a format accepted by the XGecu T76 programmer.

Also included is a simple Verilog design for testing the FPGA on the XGecu T76.

You can convert the bitstream generated by TD IDE using the following command:
```bash
 python3 gen_bit.py T76.bit out.bit
```
The resulting `out.bit` file can be downloaded to the T76 FPGA.
